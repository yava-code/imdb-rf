This project demonstrates an analysis of the tone of IMDB reviews using a random forest model. 

**Key steps:**

* Text preprocessing (HTML tag cleaning, stop word removal, lemmatization)
* Text vectorization (TF-IDF)
* Random forest model training
* Model performance evaluation

**Improvement Opportunities:**

* Model error analysis
* Experiments with other classification models
* Deeper tuning of hyperparameters
* Visualization of feature importance
